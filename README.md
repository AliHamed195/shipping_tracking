# Shipping Tracking System

## Introduction
This project is an educational project to help the beginners understand how to create their first .net core project.

The Shipping Tracking System is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate the management of shipping orders, user accounts, product inventories, and categories. Built with ASP.NET Core, this application leverages Entity Framework Core for efficient data handling and the ASP.NET Core Identity for robust user authentication and authorization.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- .NET Core SDK (version 6.x or later)
- Microsoft SQL Server (LocalDB or Express)
- Visual Studio 2019 or later (or another compatible IDE with C# support)

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Update the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to match your SQL Server instance.
4. Use the Package Manager Console to update the database with `Update-Database` command. This will create the necessary database schema.
5. Build and run the application to verify everything is set up correctly.

## Usage
After installation, the application can be accessed through a web browser. Key functionalities include:

- **Account Management:** Register new users, handle login/logout functionality, and manage user roles.
- **Category Management:** Create, update, delete, and view categories.
- **Product Management:** Add, edit, and remove products, including handling product images and categories.
- **Order Processing:** Handle order submissions, view order details, and manage shipping information.

## Further Actions for Optimization and Improvement
To enhance the application, consider the following steps:

- **Implement Repository Pattern:** Refactor the data access layer to use the Repository pattern for better abstraction and easier testing.
- **Add Alert Notifications:** Integrate a robust alert system to notify users of successful operations or errors in real-time.
- **Optimize Image Storage:** Implement efficient image storage and retrieval methods, possibly integrating a CDN for better performance.
- **Enhance Security:** Audit and improve security measures, especially around user data handling and authentication.
- **Add API Endpoints:** Expand the system's functionality by adding RESTful API endpoints for integration with external systems.
- **Automated Testing:** Develop a suite of automated tests for continuous testing and integration.
